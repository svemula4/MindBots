Abstract: 
With the advent of big data, the demand for data management and exploration has increased significantly. Today, an astonishing amount of 2.5 quintillion data is generated every day, making it challenging and cumbersome to find the right data to meet business needs. While content search tools have been available for many years and have sophisticated capabilities, they do not offer a means to manage data resources. On the other hand, data catalogs provide data management capabilities that include access rules, relevance, and fitness tags. However, content search and data catalog efforts have yet to fully leverage each other's strengths. The primary objective of this project is to explore means of enabling data catalog and content search technologies to leverage each other's key features to optimize search and enhance data security and privacy. The project examines data catalog tools like AWS Glue, Google Cloud Platform, Informatica Enterprise, and Alation, with Open Metadata as the chosen data catalog tool, an open-source tool under the Apache Atlas umbrella that provides an intuitive user interface to manage metadata. However, integrating data catalogs with content search technologies requires careful consideration of potential challenges such as data consistency, scalability of the tool, and data security. Therefore, the project relies on the integration of tools such as Elastic Search and Open Metadata using databases like Snowflake and Momentum working together to fetch data using search facets and best-fit tags features. By integrating all these tools, the potential of tools to leverage search capabilities in existing data catalogs can be enhanced, which can further improve data discovery. Overall, integrating data catalogs with content search technologies can help users quickly and easily find relevant data, discover new datasets, and collaborate more effectively.
